# ActOr(g)

The idea is to create a software that lets me picture the things i have to do in order to 
achieve something.

I want to create something resembling an activity diagram from UML but for mundane stuff, for example
in order to be able to develop this same program i have to do the following:
  
                                                                  polish the idea for the software 
                                                                /                                     \ 
start -> research of game engines in golang -> choose an engine                                           write this README.file -> start the project 
                                                                \
                                                                make some projects to learn the engine /


So basically the idea is to have a node based todo list wich allows you to create subgoals for the item in the list 
and define if you can do the in parallel or you need them to be completed in order to make the next step.
